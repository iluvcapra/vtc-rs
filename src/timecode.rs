/** Feet and Frames Representations

[[FF35mm4perf]]

35mm 4-perf film (16 frames per foot). ex: '5400+13'.

# What it is

On physical film, each foot contains a certain number of frames. For 35mm, 4-perf film (the most
common type on Hollywood movies), this number is 16 frames per foot. Feet-And-Frames was often
used in place of Keycode to quickly reference a frame in the edit.

# Where you see it

For the most part, feet + frames has died out as a reference, because digital media is not
measured in feet. The most common place it is still used is Studio Sound Departments. Many Sound
Mixers and Designers intuitively think in feet + frames, and it is often burned into the
reference picture for them.

- Telecine.
- Sound turnover reference picture.
- Sound turnover change lists.

[[FF35mm3perf]]

35mm film with 3-perf per-frame pulldown (64 perforations per foot). ex: '12+01.1'.

# What it is

3-perf footages are represented as a string with three terms, a number of feet, a
number of frames from the beginning of the foot, and an final framing term preceded by
a period, indicating how many perfs were cut off the first frame of this foot.

# Where you see it

Avid cutlists and pull lists on Avid 3 perf projects.

[[FF35mm2perf]]

# What it is

35mm 2-perf film records 32 frames in a foot of film, instead of the usual 16.
This creates a negative image with a wide aspect ratio using standard spherical
lenses and consumes half the footage per minute running time as standard 35mm,
while having a grain profile somewhat better than 16mm while not as good as
standard 35mm.

# Where you see it

35mm 2-perf formats are uncommon though still find occasional use, the process is
usually marketed as "Techniscope", the original trademark for Technicolor Italia's
2-perf format. It was historically very common in the Italian film industry prior
to digital filmmaking, and is used on some contemporary films to obtain a film look
while keeping stock and processing costs down.

[[FF16mm]]

# What it is

On 16mm film, there are forty frames of film in each foot, one perforation
per frame. However, 16mm film is edge coded every six inches, with twenty
frames per code, so the footage "1+19" is succeeded by "2+0".

# Where you see it

16mm telecines, 16mm edge codes.

/**
[Timecode] represents the frame at a particular time in a video.

New [Timecode] values are created with the [Timecode::with_seconds], [Timecode::with_frames],
and [Timecode::with_premiere_ticks] methods.

[Timecode] is a [Copy] value.

# Examples

For timecode attribute examples, see the individual methods of the [Timecode] type, such as
[Timecode::timecode]. For examples of how to construct a new timecode, see the examples on the
contructor methods like [Timecode::with_frames].

There are a number of opeations we can apply to [Timecode] values.

## Compare Timecodes

```rust
use vtc::{Timecode, rates};
let tc1 = Timecode::with_frames("01:00:00:00", rates::F23_98).unwrap();
let tc2 = Timecode::with_frames("01:00:00:00", rates::F23_98).unwrap();
let tc3 = Timecode::with_frames("00:30:00:00", rates::F23_98).unwrap();
let tc4 = Timecode::with_frames("01:30:00:00", rates::F23_98).unwrap();

assert!(tc1 == tc2);
assert!(tc1 > tc3);
assert!(tc1 < tc4);
```

## Sort_Timecodes

```rust
# use vtc::{Timecode, rates};
let tc1 = Timecode::with_frames("01:00:00:00", rates::F23_98).unwrap();
let tc2 = Timecode::with_frames("01:30:00:00", rates::F23_98).unwrap();
let tc3 = Timecode::with_frames("00:30:00:00", rates::F23_98).unwrap();

let mut timecodes = vec![tc1, tc2, tc3];

timecodes.sort();

assert_eq!(timecodes[0], tc3);
assert_eq!(timecodes[1], tc1);
assert_eq!(timecodes[2], tc2);
```

## Add Timecodes

```rust
# use vtc::{Timecode, rates};
let tc1 = Timecode::with_frames("01:00:00:00", rates::F23_98).unwrap();
let tc2 = Timecode::with_frames("00:30:00:00", rates::F23_98).unwrap();

let mut result = tc1 + tc2;

assert_eq!("01:30:00:00", result.timecode());

result += tc1;

assert_eq!("02:30:00:00", result.timecode());
```

## Subtract Timecodes

```rust
# use vtc::{Timecode, rates};
let tc1 = Timecode::with_frames("01:00:00:00", rates::F23_98).unwrap();
let tc2 = Timecode::with_frames("00:30:00:00", rates::F23_98).unwrap();

let mut result = tc1 - tc2;

assert_eq!("00:30:00:00", result.timecode());

result -= tc1;

assert_eq!("-00:30:00:00", result.timecode());
```

## Multiply Timecodes

```rust
# use vtc::{Timecode, rates};
let tc1 = Timecode::with_frames("01:00:00:00", rates::F23_98).unwrap();

let mut result = tc1 * 1.5;

assert_eq!("01:30:00:00", result.timecode());

result *= 2;

assert_eq!("03:00:00:00", result.timecode());
```

## Divide Timecodes

Dividing always acts as if floor devision had been done on the frame count of the [Timecode].

```rust
# use vtc::{Timecode, rates};
let tc1 = Timecode::with_frames("01:00:00:01", rates::F23_98).unwrap();

let result = tc1 / 1.5;

assert_eq!("00:40:00:00", result.timecode());
```

This allows divisions and remainders to give correct, complementary values:

```rust
# use vtc::{Timecode, rates};
# let tc1 = Timecode::with_frames("01:00:00:01", rates::F23_98).unwrap();
let result = tc1 % 1.5;

assert_eq!("00:00:00:01", result.timecode());
```

[DivAssign] and [RemAssign] are also implemented for [Timecode]:

```rust
# use vtc::{Timecode, rates};
let mut tc = Timecode::with_frames("01:00:00:00", rates::F23_98).unwrap();

tc /= 2;

assert_eq!("00:30:00:00", tc.timecode());

tc %= 1.65;
assert_eq!("00:00:00:01", tc.timecode())
```
